> Foreign Language Learning

Like I said, there should be no restrictions on language learning, and interest is your best teacher. Therefore, foreign language learning requires you to be interested.

In addition, the project is also used to share my self-study experience and record the learning process.

## Languages

### Russian

> Pусски! No Russian letter? No, Russian letter.

Russia is one of my favorite country of European, so I decide to learn Russian by myself. Actually, I already spent last night to learn how to pronunciate tongue vibrato P, you know what? I got it, that's really amazing, so, let we do it!

##### Letters

There are 33 letters in Russian rather than 26 letters in English, they are:

`Аа Бб Вв Гг Дд Ее Ёё Жж Зз Ии Йй Кк Лл Мм Нн Оо Пп Рр Сс Тт Уу Фф Хх Цц Чч Шш Щщ Ъъ Ыы Ьь Ээ Юю Яя`

On the other hand, you should know how to read these letters as correct pronunciation or write them as right way, hold on, I will upload some pictures about how to write them as right way later days. 

As for pronunciation video, please find it on the YouTube or Google Search.

Here is an alphbet picture write by myself, and also there is a standard one in /image/russian.

Additionally, you need to spelling these alphbets frequently like this(of course, these combinations do not necessarily exist, check it by yourself):

As well as you should write these alphbets' handwritting expertly, take some days to practice it, be patient, believe me.

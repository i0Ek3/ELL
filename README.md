## Languages

### Russian

> Pусски! No Russian letter? No, Russian letter.

Russia is one of my favorite country of European, so I decide to learn Russian by myself. Actually, I already spent last night to learn how to pronunciate tongue vibrato P, you know what? I get it, that's really amazing, so, let we do it!

##### Letters

There are 33 letters in Russian rather than 26 letters, they are:

`Аа Бб Вв Гг Дд Ее Ёё Жж Зз Ии Йй Кк Лл Мм Нн Оо Пп Рр Сс Тт Уу Фф Хх Цц Чч Шш Щщ Ъъ Ыы Ьь Ээ Юю Яя`

On the other hand, you should know how to read these letters as correct pronunciation or write them as right way, hold on, I will upload some pictures about how to write them as right way later days. 

As for pronunciation video, please find it on the youtube or Google Store...

Here is an alphbet picture write by myself, and also there is a standard one in /image/russian.

Additionally, you need to spelling these alphbets frequently like this(of course, these combinations do not necessarily exist, check it by yourself):

As well as you should write these alphbets' handwritting expertly, take some days to practice it, be patient, believe me.



### Mongolian

蒙语字母分阴性，阳性和中性。具体可以参考[这里](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odv5DN_eMAg)先学习字母的书写和读音，一定要多练。学起来感觉不会太难，和俄语中的有些字母发音很像，所以你有俄语基础的话，那么就很简单了。但书写的确需要下功夫学习练习，但书写的确需要下功夫学习练习。

读写的情况可具体练习音节拼读，类似于俄语中的拼读，练习多多益善。这里推荐一个学习平台[http://www.howzhi.com/course/5150/](http://www.howzhi.com/course/5150/)，感觉质量还不错，可以关注学习。

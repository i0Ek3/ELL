# ELL--European Languages Learning

As I said that, languages study shouldn't have limits, interested is your best teacher. So, just do it if you want it.

Additionaly, this project is also to share my learning experience, pure self-study, and also record the learning process(Yes. I always have much time to do something without coding or informals >_<!!!).

## Learning Skills

- First, you should have interested on it what you want to learn, to know it and assimilate into it.

- Letters is your second important thing of learning a new language, learn it as your own way.

- Then, a little words good for need, believe me.

- Next, you should fuck grammer, yeah, fuck it.

- Last, speak it, listen it, watch it and over again.

In a word, it's need long time to go, maybe you can learnt it with a one month or less more. But, most people need to learn it much more time, insist it you can see a miracle.


## Languages

### Russian

> Pусски! No Russian letter? No, Russian letter.

Russia is one of my favorite country of European, so I decide to learn Russian by myself. Actually, I already spent last night to learn how to pronunciate tongue vibrato P, you know what? I get it, that's really amazing, so, let we do it!

##### Letters

There are 33 letters in Russian rather than 26 letters, they are:

`Аа Бб Вв Гг Дд Ее Ёё Жж Зз Ии Йй Кк Лл Мм Нн Оо Пп Рр Сс Тт Уу Фф Хх Цц Чч Шш Щщ Ъъ Ыы Ьь Ээ Юю Яя`

On the other hand, you should know how to read these letters as correct pronunciation or write them as right way, hold on, I will upload some pictures about how to write them as right way later days. 

As for pronunciation video, please find it on the youtube or Google Store...

Here is an alphbet picture write by myself, and also there is a standard one in /image/russian.
